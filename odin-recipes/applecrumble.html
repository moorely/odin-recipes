    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother
      Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at
      a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. There is never
      any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>7 large Cortland apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <ol>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square
        glass casserole dish. Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut
        in with a pastry blender. Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and
        pat down.
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping
        is browned, about 55 minutes.
      </ol>
    </ul>
